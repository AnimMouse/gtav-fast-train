# Grand Theft Auto V Fast Train and Tram
This is a mod for GTA V to make the train and the tram faster.

You can even configure the speed of the train if you want it even faster!

## Informations
The train track that have a filename "trains1.dat" is the train/freight track.

The train track that have a filename "trains4.dat" is the tram/subway/metro track.

The speed value in meters per second determines how fast is the train.

The brakingDist determine how far the train will brake in meters.

## The value of the braking distance

Based on our experiment, the value of the brakingDist of the freight track should be the speed multipiled by 4.

Ex. If speed is 40, brakingDist should be 160.

While the value of the brakingDist of the metro track should be the speed multipiled by 3.

Ex. If speed is 35, brakingDist should be 105.

If the brakingDist is lower than the suggested value, the train will never stop at the train station.

If the brakingDist is higher than the suggested value, the train will stop before the train station.
